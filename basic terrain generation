/**
   This code generates ground sections infinitely:
     - Any ground/ceiling assets must be given a numerical name eg: 6, and that must be unique.
     - All ground (and ceiling) objects must be tagged "Ground" in order to avoid an error and they must be a prefab stored in the Prefab folder under a Resources folder
     - It may be neccesary to edit the right edge of the ground object to avoid rigidbody collisions between ground objects
     - Note the time between batch spawns can effect how the change ground timer works
     - All of the above is a bit of a pain, but it makes it more efficent

        THIS CODE CURRENTLY WRITTEN FOR UNITY3D :)))
